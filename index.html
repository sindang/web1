						<p>"WWW" and "The Web" redirect here. For other uses of WWW, see WWW (disambiguation). For other uses of web, see Web (disambiguation).
						For the first web software, see WorldWideWeb.
						Not to be confused with the Internet.
						The <strong>World Wide Web (WWW)</strong>, commonly known as the Web, is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://www.example.com/), which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible via the Internet.[1] The resources of the WWW may be accessed by users via a software application called a web browser.
						English scientist Tim Berners-Lee is credited with inventing the World Wide Web while working for CERN on March 12, 1989, by submitting Information Management: A Proposal and writing the first web browser in 1990. The browser was released outside CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet in August 1991. The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet.
